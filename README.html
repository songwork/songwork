<h1>Songwork</h1>
<p>
Songwriting instruction from hit songwriters.  Right now that's just selling videos, but eventually will be scheduling private instruction, subscribing to access all videos, uploading songs for group feedback, and maybe even a contest.
</p>

<h2>Schema</h2>
<p>
An <strong>admin</strong> person can add a new songwriting <strong>teacher</strong> to the system. A <strong>student</strong> can sign up on the site at any time. All of these people are using a person_id to reference the central “people” database for their name, email, password, etc.
</p><p>
Teacher creates a <strong>document</strong>, which is usually a video but could be a PDF, Word, MP3, or anything else for sale.  A document has a name, description, date, bytesize, type, price, and hidden server-side url/filename outside the webroot where it can be downloaded once paid.  It has an optional YouTube URL to give a little pre-purchase preview of it.
</p><p>
A document can have multiple teachers.  The teachers equally split the sale revenue from that document.
</p><p>
Prices are done with a <strong>priceref</strong>: a simple letter-code (like “a”) that corresponds to a price in many currencies.  It's done this way so people worldwide can ship and see prices rounded in their currency.  For example: “a” corresponds to $10, €7.50, £6.50, and ¥900 - all about equal value.  The customer chooses the currency, and that's exactly what we charge them.  (Example: exactly ¥900, not the equivalent of $10 in yen.)  I like this model a lot and will probably use it on many other projects.
</p><p>
A document can have more than one <strong>tag</strong>.  Right now tags are only created and assigned by admins or teachers, and used to ease browsing of the site.
</p><p>
When a student buys a document, it creates a <strong>payment</strong>, referencing the student.id and document.id, and saving the details of that payment.  This is what gives the student the ability to view or download the document.
</p><p>
All incoming activity to our PayPal gateway is saved as a <strong>paypaltxn</strong> (<em>“txn” = transaction</em>) with all PayPal's info, referencing the payment.id and a boolean flag for whether that transaction is reconciled.
</p>

<h2>Site</h2>
<p>
For students, songwork.com is to browse, buy, and watch videos, communicate with teachers, and edit their info.
</p><p>
For teachers, songwork.com is to add or edit their documents, see accounting for their payments, give feedback to students, schedule consultations, and edit their info.
</p><p>
For admins, songwork.com can see, add, or edit all info in the database - and see a list of payments due.
</p><p>
The browsing of the Songwork documents does not require authentication.  But a student record will need to be created and authenticated for them if they buy.  Authentication will be needed for all teacher and admin areas, and all student-account pages.
</p><p>
New documents added by teachers are not active (“added_at”) by default.  They are added to the site by the admin, after verifying that everything is ready.
</p><p>
Each of the three roles of browser-users have a subdirectory: /s/ for student, /t/ for teacher, /a/ for admin.  When a person successfully logs in, they are sent to the appropriate subdirectory. This allows for uniformity of URLs, but with the appropriate views and permissions.
</p><p>
The top-level URLs are for the REST API.  Optionally: all the forms in the subdirectories can do all their POST/PUT/DELETE to the REST URLs in the top-level, so all of that functionality is not duplicated.  <strong>Tight permissions</strong> on all, to ensure that teachers can only change their documents, students can only see/create their own info, and admins can change anything, but not (for example) delete a student who has payments.
</p>
