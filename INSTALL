TO INSTALL THIS ON YOUR DEVELOPMENT MACHINE:

You must be running Linux, BSD, or OS X.  No Windows.

You must have installed Apache, PHP, Git, PostgreSQL, and "postgres-contrib" (to get the pgcrypto functions)
For PHP, you'll need to install phpunit, php-pgsql, and a few more. (based on missing errors)

This requires some modifications to Apache's main config:
DefaultType application/x-httpd-php
DirectoryIndex index.html home

You have to make an entry in your /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1  songwork.dev

Get it from github:
git clone http://github.com/songwork/songwork.git

Then this in your Apache VirtualHosts:
<VirtualHost *:80>
  ServerName songwork.dev
  DocumentRoot /your/path/to/songwork/web
  php_value include_path /your/path/to/songwork/php
</VirtualHost>

PostgreSQL needs its pg_hba.conf set to: local all all trust
Then 'createuser songwork' and make it a super-user so it can install the pgcrypto functions

And finally, to run the phpunit tests, your php.ini for the PHP CLI must have these settings:
include_path = ".:../php:/usr/share/pear" 

To test your initial install, go to /test/ directory and run: sh regen-scratch.sh

When that works, run: sh alltest.sh

When that works, load the fixtures.pgsql into the main database like this:
pgsql -U songwork -d songwork -f fixtures.pgsql

Then go to http://songwork.dev/ in your browser.

Click around and try logging in as different users, or creating a new user, to make sure it works.

Feel free to ask me any questions.
